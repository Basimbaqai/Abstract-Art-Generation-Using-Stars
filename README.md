# Constellation Image Generation with Deep Learning

This project focuses on training deep learning models to detect constellations, connect the stars to form lines, and generate images of the constellations. The goal is to build a system that can recognize and visualize constellations from star data.

## Features

- **Star Detection**: Using a deep learning model to identify stars in the night sky.
- **Line Generation**: Connecting the identified stars to form the lines that represent constellations.
- **Image Generation**: Generating visual representations of constellations using a generative model.

## Tech Stack

### Deep Learning Models:


- ** Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs)** or other image generation models to visualize constellations.
- ** Large Vision Models (LVMs)** such as Kandinsky or Flux 1.dev

### Libraries & Frameworks:

- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** (for deep learning model training)
- **OpenCV** (for image processing tasks)
- **NumPy, Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)

### Data:

- **Star data** (coordinates of stars in the sky) to train the models.
- **Images of constellations** or star maps for visualization and training the image generation model.
