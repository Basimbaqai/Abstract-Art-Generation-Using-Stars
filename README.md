# Star Points Connection & Generation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for generating, visualizing, and analyzing star point connections to form constellations. The notebook leverages mathematical and computational techniques to simulate and interpret star patterns, which can be applied in astronomy-related projects or educational contexts.

## Features

- **Star Point Generation**: Create random or predefined star patterns.
- **Constellation Formation**: Connect points based on various algorithms or rules.
- **Visualization**: Interactive and static plots for clear representation.
- **Customization**: Options to modify parameters like density, connectivity, and star properties.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/star-points-generation.git
   cd star-points-generation
